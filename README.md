Software I have written
Folders are projects I have written for zemanim program in either c or VB6

Programs written in VB6 ---------------------------------
1. NewPlotting - plotting program written in VB6 
very user friendly, has also fitting routines for polynomial and spline fits
2. CalProgram - program for calculating zemanim -- needs netzski6.exe module to calculate zemanim as well as the city data
3. MapDigitizer - program for digitizing and handling topo maps - full of useful, unique, and nifty routines including
following contours, storing images for realtime editing, contouring maps, determing visible horizon of area on map
Do work properly needs access to a DTM database, typically the JKH 25 m DTM of Israel and the NED 30 m DEM in hgt format


Progams written in c ------------------------

1. netzski6_c - porgram for calcuating zemanim, written in calcuating
2. rdhalba4 -program for calculating profiles from ITM based EY DTM
3. readDTM - program for calculating profiles for SRTM and DEM DTM'sheeting
4. StringRoutines - programs used for calculating the ChaiTables
